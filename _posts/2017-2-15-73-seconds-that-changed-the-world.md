While we get buried in sleet and snow, we remember a Brother lost decades ago.

<!-- excerpt -->

Theme: Snow Cascades across the decades

> On January 28th, 1986 the Space Shuttle Challenger took flight. Tragically, after 73 seconds, the shuttle exploded in air. A small engineering failure caused an internal explosion that rocked the world of space flight for years to come. A Triangle Brother from the University of Colorado, Ellison Onizuka, was aboard this spacecraft during the accident. This moment will forever remain in the memories of Triangle Brothers across the nation as the loss of an excellent man. Onizuka was known for his achievement in the fields of engineering and science as well as his distinguished career as an astronaut. The statue before you features a snowy resemblance of the launch pad, including the support tower, service arm, and Challenger Space Shuttle.
