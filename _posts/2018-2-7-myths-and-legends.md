title *What Really Happened*

> On June 25 2013, 8 years after a Freedom of Information Act request was filed, the CIA for the first time publically acknowledged the existence of the United States Air Force base known as Area 51. The site, commonly recognized for its accused holding of extraterrestrial aircraft, is a top secret test site for many experimental weapons and defense systems. The supposititious rendering of the site before you features a captured UFO in- transit to a secret compound. The hangar gate is supported by a hidden wooden cross member. Emerging research on extraterrestrial life is performed right before your eyes.
