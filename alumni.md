# Alumni Board
While the Alumni Board is comprised of specific positions, we encourage any and everyone to be active within the alumni group. Even if you can only spare a few minutes of your time, we could always use it! Please contact [Alex Ott](mailto:ajott@mtu.edu) to get on our Alumni Executive Board email list.
