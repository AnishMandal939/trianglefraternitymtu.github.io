# Reunion

## Labor Day Weekend, 2020

With a larger number of involved alumni, and with the aim of getting back in touch with those who have drifted away, the need was identified for a large event to bring people together. The Alumni Reunion is held every 5 years, with the next being in 2020.

# Details
